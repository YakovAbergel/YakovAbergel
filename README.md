- 👋 Hi, I'm @YakovAbergel, I'm 27 years old and live in Tel Aviv, Israel.
- 👀 I'm interested in software development, and learning programming languages and new things related to software :)
- 🌱 I am currently a fourth year computer science student at the Open University.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects, and of course also find an interesting job in software development where I can develop and give as much of myself as possible!
